BANK = """
=== THEORY ===
LANGUAGE: c
DIFFICULTY: medium
QUESTION:
Why pass a pointer to a function instead of the value?
MODEL ANSWER:
The function gets the address, so it can change the caller's variable, and a large
struct is not copied.
KEY POINTS:
- the function receives the variable's address
- it can change the caller's variable through it
- nothing large is copied
=== END ===
