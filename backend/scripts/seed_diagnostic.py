"""Load the verified diagnostic bank into diagnostic_items, inside the backend container:

    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.local.yml exec backend python -m scripts.seed_diagnostic

Reads app/data/diagnostic.json (written by scripts.generate_diagnostic). Rerunning is safe:
rows are upserted by external_id and an unchanged row keeps its review. A reviewed row
whose kind, body or key changed goes back to unreviewed, since only what a human checked
is served. Approve rows with scripts.review_diagnostic."""
